This project is the implementation of simple OS which can perform primary read and write functions. Instructions are written in OS.txt. 
At the time of program execution, commands are read from OS.txt, executed and result is stored in output.txt file.
IDE used: Codeblocks

# Commands our OS executes:

## GD : get data from given memory location 
Example : GD10

## PD : put data at given memory location
Example : PD20

## LR : load data from given memory location to register
